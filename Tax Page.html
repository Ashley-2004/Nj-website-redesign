                <h2><bold> Important Tax Information: </bold></h2>
                <hr>
                <p> The federal government recently adopted a new tax plan that includes a combined deduction limit on property taxes of $10,000 to begin in 2018.  Due to this change, property owners have been inquiring about pre-paying property taxes in 2017 for 2018.<br><br>
 
                    The City of Union City will accept pre-payments of 2018 taxes in 2017 and, as a convenience to property owners, the Tax Collector's Office will remain open until 6 PM on December 29, 2017.  Property owners may also pay online through December 31, 2017. Credit Cards can be used online, but can not be accepted in person at the office.<br><br>
                     
                    Property owners may estimate their tax bill based on the 2017 bill. If changes occur to individual bills based on tax rate changes or revaluations, you will either have a credit or balance in 2018. <br><br>
                     
                    The City of Union City cannot offer you advice concerning your pre-payment of taxes and individuals should consult their tax advisors.  The information and extended hours are provided as a courtesy to property owners.<br><br>
