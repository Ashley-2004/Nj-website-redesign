                    Union City is easily accessible by public transportation. NJ Trans
                    it and other buses and independent commuter vans traverse the city almost 24 hours a
                     day, seven days a week and buses leave from Union City to most of northern New Jersey, New York,
                      and Miami. Transportation to Manhattan is available via the Lincoln Tunnel, the approach to which runs underneath our streets; bus; and, within a short shuttle
                       bus ride or car drive, ferry. Construction on a new light rail station in the uptown section of the 
                       city is slated to begin next year. This station will connect Union City by rail to
                     the entire northeast region of the country.

                      in Bergen County - about a half-hour's drive).
